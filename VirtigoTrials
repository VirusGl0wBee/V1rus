''' Write a text-based game where the player has to survive an entire day of fighting 
monsters. The player will need basic stats like health, attack, and defense. There needs
to be a variety of monsters to fight, each with their own stats. There needs to be a 
time system that advances as the player fights monsters. The player will be able to win 
by surviving the entire day and sleeping at night. The player will lose if their health
drops to zero. '''
